This year, I wound up getting a gold Leichturm 1917. I knew art deco would fit perfectly with the shiny gold cover.

I then remembered the poster for <em>Metropolis</em>.

It's such a bold, imposing illustration that sticks in your mind. I knew I wanted to allude to it somehow.

It was a good day. I listened to Siouxsie and the Banshees while busting out these spreads in time for 2019. Quite happy with how it turned out!

## Monthly Spread

This is the monthly spread I always mock up. Super simple and doesn't take that long to draw. I find it's just enough space for each day.
